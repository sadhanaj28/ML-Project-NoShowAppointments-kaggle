# NoShowAppointments-kaggle
I have selected NoShowAppointment data, which have collected patient's details. Data has the scheduledDay, appointmentDay, Gender, Age, other related including NoShow. Here, NoShow tells that patient came on scheduledDay or not.  I am going to do analysis to find out what would be various reasons for missing their scheduledDay
